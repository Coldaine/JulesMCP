# MCP Framework Strategy: Executive Brief

**Date:** October 2025  
**Status:** Updated Recommendation  
**Decision Required:** Framework Selection for Production Deployment

## TL;DR

**Previous Plan:** Migrate to EasyMCP framework  
**New Recommendation:** Migrate to FastMCP 2.0 framework  
**Reason:** Production-ready features vs beta stability  

## The Question

What Model Context Protocol (MCP) framework should we use to replace our custom backend implementation?

## The Answer

**FastMCP 2.0** - Production-ready framework with enterprise features built-in.

## Why This Matters

Our current custom MCP implementation is a maintenance burden. We need a framework to:
1. Reduce long-term technical debt
2. Accelerate feature development
3. Enable production deployment
4. Align with MCP ecosystem evolution

## What Changed?

### Original Analysis (mergeAnalysis.md)
- Recommended **EasyMCP**
- Rationale: Developer-friendly, Express-like API
- Timeline: 9-13 weeks

### New Analysis (strategicUpdate.md)
- Recommends **FastMCP 2.0**
- Rationale: Production features, session persistence, enterprise auth
- Timeline: 11-15 weeks (includes production hardening)

### Key Research Findings

1. **EasyMCP is Beta** - Limited production features, stability concerns
2. **FastMCP 2.0 is Production-Ready** - Battle-tested, enterprise-grade
3. **Session Persistence Critical** - FastMCP 2.0 has it built-in
4. **Enterprise Auth Required** - FastMCP 2.0 supports Google/GitHub/Azure/Auth0

## The Impact

### What We Gain
✅ Built-in session persistence (no custom code)  
✅ Enterprise authentication out of the box  
✅ WebSocket real-time communication  
✅ Production deployment tooling  
✅ Lower long-term maintenance  

### What It Costs
⚠️ 2-3 weeks additional initial effort  
⚠️ New framework patterns to learn  
⚠️ Some architectural adjustments  

### Net Result
🎯 **Faster path to production-ready system** despite higher upfront cost

## Decision Framework

| Criterion | EasyMCP | FastMCP 2.0 | Winner |
|-----------|---------|-------------|--------|
| Production Readiness | ❌ Beta | ✅ Stable | **FastMCP 2.0** |
| Session Persistence | ❌ Build it | ✅ Built-in | **FastMCP 2.0** |
| Enterprise Auth | ⚠️ Basic | ✅ Full | **FastMCP 2.0** |
| Developer Experience | ✅ Express-like | ✅ Decorator-based | Tie |
| Initial Migration | ✅ Lower | ⚠️ Medium | EasyMCP |
| Long-term Maintenance | ❌ Higher | ✅ Lower | **FastMCP 2.0** |
| **Overall Winner** | | | **FastMCP 2.0** |

## Recommended Next Steps

### Week 1: Validate
- Review FastMCP 2.0 documentation
- Set up proof-of-concept environment
- Test session persistence scenarios

### Weeks 2-4: Prove
- Build core session management prototype
- Validate authentication integration
- Benchmark performance vs current system
- **Make final decision based on POC results**

### Months 2-3: Migrate (if POC successful)
- Backend migration to FastMCP 2.0
- Frontend integration with client SDK
- Production hardening

### Month 4+: Enhance
- Deploy to production
- Implement aspirational features
- Build multi-agent orchestration

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- FastMCP 2.0 community is active and responsive
- Framework is production-tested
- Migration path is well-documented

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- Framework lock-in (mitigated by abstraction layer)
- Learning curve for new patterns

### Mitigation Strategy
1. Thorough POC before full commitment
2. Abstract business logic from framework
3. Maintain fallback plan to official TypeScript SDK
4. Document all framework-specific decisions

3. **[mergeAnalysis.md](./mergeAnalysis.md)** ← Original EasyMCP recommendation
4. **[MCPResearch.md](./MCPResearch.md)** ← Research objectives

## Bottom Line

**Switch from EasyMCP to FastMCP 2.0 recommendation because:**
1. Production readiness > Developer convenience
2. Built-in features > Custom implementations
3. Lower maintenance > Lower initial effort
4. Enterprise-grade > Beta stability

**Action Required:** Approve FastMCP 2.0 proof-of-concept phase to validate capabilities before full migration.
